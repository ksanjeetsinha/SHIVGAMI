A test-dataset of 2,288 Kinase nucleotide FASTA sequences (Performance_test1_input.fasta), obtained from NCBI, used as query for the blastx process against NCBI's NR database on a server using 40 hyper-threaded cores and using SHIVGAMI on 6 Personal Computers (PC) using 36 (6 core each) hyper-threaded cores. 
The server completed the process in 8 hr 31 min 06 sec, while using SHIVGAMI on 6 PC, the process completed in 6 hr 20 min 8 sec, simply SHIVGAMI with normal PC outperforms a high-end server!
